        <p>It is easy to assume that kids who do not perform well in school are either lazy, stupid or do not work hard enough.</p>
        <p>And maybe that's true, but what if every kid had access to quality education and training, had access to necessary resources, and lived in nice and quiet neighbohoods?</p>
            
        Disciplina Labs Pty Ltd is a South African tech company believing that the difference between getting good and bad grades is access to quality education and necessary resources, not intelligence. 
        Hence, we are committed to providing tools, resources and opportunities for better learning experiences and outcomes for all, with a long-term goal to <b>reduce dropout rates</b> in south African and therefore create a promising future.

            </p>

             <p>According to Zero DropOut, around 40% of Grade 1 students never make it to Grade 12 despite South Africa's large investment in basic education. 
                And estimates, shows that the average dropout across each Grade comes to about 4.5%; however, most occur from Grades 9 to 11.
                The Centre for Development and Enterprise (CDE), Highlighted that South Africa has one of the worst-performing education systems in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                With several international benchmarks also highlighting the dire state of South Africa's education system over the last two decades, for example, out of 39 participating countries, South Africa's Grade 9 learners - on a test designed for Grade 8s - placed 38th (second last) in mathematics proficiency and last place (39th) in science proficiency. 
                The situation is worsened by the absence of quality teachers in South Africa, with only 41% of South African teachers having adequate proficiency levels, far lower than Kenya (95%) and Zimbabwe (87%) (Source: Business Tech, South Africa's shocking school dropout rate revealed).</p>
                <p>
                  Based on these factors, our focus is therefore on FET Phase.
